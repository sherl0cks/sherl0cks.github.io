      <title>KIE Server Authentication &amp; Authorization For Human Tasks</title>
      <link>http://sherl0cks.github.io//using-kie-server-to-get-a-task-list</link>
      <description>One of the most exciting features developed in the [KIE Community](http://www.kiegroup.org/) and released in [Red Hat BxMS 6.2+](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_BPM_Suite/6.2/html/6.2.0_Release_Notes/ch01s02.html) is the unified KIE Server. If you are new to this subject, you should probably start with a great series of blogs from [Maciej Swiderski on the KIE Server](http://mswiderski.blogspot.com/2015/09/unified-kie-execution-server-part-1.html). One of the primary reasons that companies deploy KIE Server is to develop custom UI's for their end users, while still leveraging the powerful jBPM engine for process management and execution. In jBPM 6.4 and Red Hat BPM Suite 6.3, we even released [a REST API specifically designed for custom HTML/JS UI's](http://mswiderski.blogspot.com/2016/03/jbpm-ui-extension-on-kie-server.html) as well as support for [custom queries on your process and task data](http://mswiderski.blogspot.com/2016/01/advanced-queries-in-kie-server.html) to support sophisticated task dashboards.

      <title>Introducing the Business Automation Design Patterns</title>
      <link>http://sherl0cks.github.io//introducing-the-business-automaton-design-patterns</link>
      <description>Red Hat is in the process of publishing a set of design patterns to help those deploying business automation systems. The goal is to enable practioners to easily reason about their solution architecture in the large. In order to achieve this objective, we enumerate the high level design decisions that a practioner needs to maker and then we provide proscriptive guidaince on how to make those decisions. The following slide decks will walk you through the approach at different levels. Please note that this material is constantly evolving based on field experience:

      <title>Selecting A Blog Platform</title>
      <link>http://sherl0cks.github.io//selecting-a-blog-platform</link>
      <description>Setting up a blog has been on my `TODO` list for several years. I've spent a lot of time over the last few years reading blogs from smart people like [Dan North](http://dannorth.net/blog/), [Martin Fowler](http://www.martinfowler.com/), [Cristian Posta](http://blog.christianposta.com/), [Jeff Patton](http://jpattonassociates.com/blog/), [Eric Schabell](http://www.schabell.org/), [Dean Leffingwell](http://www.scaledagileframework.com/author/deanleffingwell/) and [Maciej Swiderski](http://mswiderski.blogspot.com/) (just to name a few). But sharing my own ideas... Well that has only happened in small and sporadic bits, largely via [whitepapers](https://engage.redhat.com/forms/bdd?sc_cid=70160000000bqcVAAQ&amp;offer_id=70160000000brtPAAQ) and [presentations](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/events/using-bpm-enable-devops-values-enterprise) for Red Hat. So after years of encouragement (thanks Haden), I've decided it's time to make this idea a reality.
